### **Starting an Encounter**
At the start of combat, draw 1 minion per player in the game (not per room). Minions and players attack simultaneously. Any minion damage that is not blocked is applied directly to player health.

Minions come in various types, each with unique effects and actions. Refer to the icon guide below to interpret their abilities. Refer to [Icons](http://127.0.0.1:8000/Icons.html) for a continually updated list of minions and their effects.



### **Combat Rules**

- **Persistent Damage:** Any damage dealt to a minion from previous turns carries over; however, this does not weaken the minion’s attacks.

- **Retreating:** Players may choose to retreat at the start of their turn, before taking any other actions (except using the boot; symbol to exit the room). Retreating means forfeiting all gold rewards from the encounter.

- **Movement Restrictions:** Players cannot move past minions into a new room, nor can they access corner tiles while minions remain active.



### **Ending an Encounter**
- **Gold Distribution:** Players receive gold as indicated on defeated minion cards. Gold must be evenly divided among all party members on the same tile.

- **Accessing Tile Corners:** Once all minions are defeated, players may explore the tile’s corners. If a corner contains a chest, a key or a specific card ability is required to open it.
