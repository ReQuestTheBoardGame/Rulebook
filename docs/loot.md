The loot deck consists of both loot cards and potion cards. Loot is found inside chests, which generally require a key (or a special card) to unlock. The exception is the chest on the Loot Room tile, which is already unlocked and grants players free access.

**All loot cards are single-use unless otherwise noted.**
