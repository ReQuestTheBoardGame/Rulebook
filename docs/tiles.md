### **Setup Instructions**

- Select the appropriate boss tiles and remove the Portal Tile and Boss Room Door Tile from the general tile pool.

- Shuffle the remaining tiles and place them face down in a stack to form the dungeon.

- Place the Portal Tile at the center of the play area—this is the players' starting point.

- Place the Boss Tile at the bottom of the tile stack. This marks the final encounter of the dungeon.


### **Placement Rules**

- When placing new tiles, doors may be aligned in any direction.

- Do not connect a locked door to a newly placed tile unless the party has a key.

- If a door connects to a wall, treat it as a dead end.


### **Tile Quantities**

The total number of tiles used depends on the selected boss type:

**Tutorial Boss:** 6 tiles

**Lich:** 16 tiles
