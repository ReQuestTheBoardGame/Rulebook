The Alchemist is a creative and versatile subclass that adds a unique twist to traditional gameplay. Though it falls under the Boots class, the Alchemist specializes in crafting and sharing potions using ingredients in place of raw actions.

### **How to Play the Alchemist Class**
Most Alchemist cards feature boot; raw actions, but these can often be substituted for ingredients used in potion-making. Crafting potions is the Alchemist’s primary strength, offering tactical and team-based advantages.

### **Potions** &nbsp;&nbsp; cbpotion;50
Potions are one-time-use items and do not enter your deck. Instead, they stay in your play area until used. Potions can be shared with other players—but only if they are on the same tile as the Alchemist.

### **Setting Up Potions**
- Choose 4 potion types to be available during the game.

- Place the four potion cards face up in your play area, separated into distinct piles.

- Collect the ingredients needed to make each potion twice. 


**Example:** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; healingpotion;100 **=** fungus;75 fungus;75 fungus;75 fungus;75 bonemeal;75 bonemeal;75

Shuffle all collected ingredients together and place them face down in your play area.

### **Potion & Ingredient Limits**
