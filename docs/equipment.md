Equipment cards provide players with tactical options in the form of actions and abilities, often allowing a choice between the two.

- The left side of the card lists its basic actions.

- The right side shows the cost of the card.

- The bottom includes any special abilities and bonuses.


### **How to Use**
Most equipment offers players a choice: Use the card for its raw actions, or forgo those actions to activate its special ability.
If an ability requires actions from the card, it will be marked with an asterisk (*).

**Example:** The Battering Ram may have an ability that uses only 1 or 2 specific actions, which will be explicitly noted with an * in the ability description.

### **Bonuses**
Most equipment cards include a bonus effect that can be triggered under certain conditions. By default, bonuses can only be triggered once per turn, regardless of how many copies of the card you hold.

Some bonuses, however, are marked with an asterisk (*), indicating that they can be triggered once per card, not per turn.

### **Acquire**
Some cards have acquire effects, which activate only onceâ€”when the card is purchased or picked up from the market.
