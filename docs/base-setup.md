**All Boss Types**

**Starter Decks:** Each player begins with a Starter Deck containing 10 base single action cards (as shown below). 8 of these cards include Boot (2), Shield (2), Sword (2), and Magic (2). For the last two cards, players will have their choice of the base single action cards. This may be any combination (magic; & shield;, 2 magic;, 2 sword;, etc).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Market:** [Equipment Cards](http://127.0.0.1:8000/equipment.html) are arranged in rows by cost. Equipment cards are chosen by the players as a group, choosing 12 different sets of equipment cards. For first time players, we suggest using the four basic upgrade cards (shown below), plus 8 additional equipment card types according to interest (swords/shields, etc). Each set of cards should have 6 copies.

**Loot Deck:** Loot cards are designated by the loot; icon on the back of the card. Additionally, take any four different potion cards, and the loot cards shuffling them all together. Set the deck off to the side, this is the loot deck.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


**Player Cards:** Each player should have a printed player card. Each player card should have 3 sliders: Health (1-10), Magic (1-5) and Wilds (1-5). To utilize the card fully, cut slits where the dotted lines are. Insert the sliders and use accordingly.
