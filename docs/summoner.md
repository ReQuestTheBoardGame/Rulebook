### **How to Play the Summoner Class**
The Summoner is a magic-based subclass that focuses on minion control. Playing this class revolves around the “acquire” mechanic to unlock your minion slots.

### **Unlocking Summoning Slots**
Cards like Slime Rod include an acquire effect that grants +1 minion slot when purchased. You may increase your minion capacity up to a maximum of 5. Each time you acquire a card that grants a minion slot, your capacity increases by one.

### **Summoning Minions**
As the Summoner, you recruit minions from the previous boss you've defeated and use them in future encounters. For example, in the tutorial, you'll defeat the Slimes. These become your minions in the fight against the Lich. After defeating the Lich, you may summon Lich minions to fight the next boss.

### **Summoning Rules**
- Each minion has a power level (top-left corner of the minion card). To summon a minion, spend an amount of magic equal to its power level. Example: A Level 5 minion requires 5 magic to summon.

- Summons only last until the end of the turn.

- You may not summon more minions than the number of summoning slots you have acquired, regardless of how much magic you have.


### **Minion Abilities**

Many minions include special abilities such as:

- Wall; Acts as a shield.

- Pick pocket; Steals resources.

- Wolf pack; Gains bonuses with multiple allies.

These abilities are factored into the power level of the minion and are usable by the Summoner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: The gold value listed on minion cards is not used by the Summoner.
