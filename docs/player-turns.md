### **Simultaneous Play**
Each round, all players take their turns simultaneously. During a turn, players may perform various actions such as moving, attacking, healing, defending, and buying. At the start of the game, each player begins with all 10 cards in hand. Each turn, they must play 5 cards. The remaining 5 are used on the following turn. Once all 10 cards have been played, the full set is returned to the player’s hand. Discarded cards do not return until the full cycle is complete. Cards cannot be carried over between turns—any unplayed cards must be discarded at the end of the turn.


### **Actions**
- boot; Boots allow movement to adjacent rooms or through secret passageways. 1boot; = 1 movement
- shield; Shields provide defense against minion attacks. 1shield; = 1 defense
- sword; Swords are used to damage minions. 1sword; = 1 attack
- magic; Magic is stored on your player card using the slider. There is a storage maximum of 5 magic unless that player has a card that specifies otherwise. 2 Magic may be used to heal any player 1 health.
- wild; Any 4 actions may be used to store 1 Wild action (stored on your player card). Wild actions may be used at any time in place of any of the four basic actions.

### **Exploring**
Players may use one boot per movement. In minion rooms, minions spawn upon entry. Players may spend another boot to exit immediately—without using actions in that room. Minion rooms block further movement and access to tile corners until defeated, unless a card allows otherwise.

### **Buying**
Buying can occur at any time during a turn, but players may only replace cards that are currently in their discard pile. Each purchase must maintain the deck size of exactly 10 cards—every new card bought must replace an existing card in the discard pile.

### **Exchanging**
Players may share gold or loot cards with each other, but only if they are on the same tile. Actions cannot be shared, though multiple players may coordinate their actions with cooperative actions (such as bringing down the tracker in the Lich). Magic may be used to heal another player, but it cannot be transferred or given to another player for storage or later use.

### **Ending a Turn**
5 Cards must be used or discarded each turn. No cards will be carried over into the next turn. All players must finish the turn before anyone can move on to the next.
